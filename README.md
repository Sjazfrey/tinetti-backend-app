# tinetti
**I set up a Tinetti balance website, so later I can deploy it to an mobile app using React. I found 1 other mobile app out there, but my therapist friends do not like it and want a different one that has better functionality.**
*Used MVC and 7 RESTful routes.
*Express, EJS, Mongo and Mongoose.
*Heroku: http://tinetti.herokuapp.com/
*Used Bootstrap for CSS styling.


I didn't do sessions due to started at the end of my project so I was very difficult to go back and reroute my routes to set it up corrctly. I wish I would have done this first.
